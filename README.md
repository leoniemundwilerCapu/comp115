# comp115
This is my first project for Comp115.
This should show a ocean view on sunrise or sunset. In switzerland i don't see the ocean, and even if I don't like the ocean, but I realised here that it can be pretty beautiful. In addition I made two versions, one with a big fish in the water and one without. I don't know which composition I like more. 
I hope whoever reads that has fun with reading my code and looking at the pictures.
